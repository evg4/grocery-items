## Project Title
Grocery items
## Description
This was completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path and uses create-react-app. The purpose of this was to practise using props. I also added some extra features, such as a button to calculate total price. I suspect there is a better way to do this, as my method of using a switch statement to iterate through an array of the items in the basket seems inefficient because I have to manually add new items and their prices to the switch statement whenever I add a new grocery item button. However at this stage I couldn't figure out how to access the price props from each grocery item as I am still new to React. This is something I will learn for the future.
